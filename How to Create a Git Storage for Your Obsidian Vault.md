_It took almost 2 hours to figure out the simplest procedure_ 
I might be over simplifying this but it was definitely worth all the pain.

## Start with GitHub
- Start with creating a Git Repository 
	- You can log into your GitHub account and click on `create new repository`  from the screen
	- Ensure that you follow this format while your creating a new repository `username.github.io` . Keep your account `Public` in case you are willing to publish your Obsidian notes. 
		Keeping your account public will allow you to access GitHub pages.
